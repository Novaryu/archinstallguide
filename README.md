# Arch Linux Comprehensive Installation Guide
This guide is for noobs or people like me who still don't remember certain commands even after installing arch 10 times.

Or for those who are tired of navigating to multiple different pages in the arch wiki to find one command.
(BTW I <3 the Arch Wiki and my install would not have been possible without it)

Regardless, I've installed on enough devices to know that some things are universal. I have added such things in this document.
Keep in mind, as always, that YMMV and different hardware often demands a different approach.
